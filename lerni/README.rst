Lerni - learn everything reasonably, not irrationally
-----------------------------------------------------

Taking Learning How to Learn made me aware of many new (to me) learing strategies and tactics. Through this project, I hope to assemble the best of these to create a new learning system.


Review of Previous Work
-----------------------

Hypercard
	perhaps the seminal work, primitive by today's standards, but it was good for its time.

Supermemo
	the first (that I know of) flashcard program that used spaced repetition. supermemo.com presents a lot of useful research.

Anki
	an opensource replacement?? for supermemo. quite mature and flexible, but in need of refactoring to grow beyond a flash-card program. Useful as is in a larger system.

Mnemosyne
	similiar to Anki, with a better interface, but less flexible. publishing anonymous statistics is an interesting idea. I want to look at the data.

edX
	an opensource platform for creating courses.

Coursera
	is coursera's platform open?

Udacity
	I think Udacity has the best UI of the BigThree. Is it open?

Kahn Academy
	very good testing component. presentation limited.


Epub
	would it be possible to package an entire course, including video and flashcards into a .epub container?
